# Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). Objects are instances of classes, which serve as blueprints for creating objects. OOP emphasizes the organization of code into manageable, reusable components.
